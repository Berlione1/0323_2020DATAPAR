Do sharks prefer men or women ? 

As expected and it is what we can notice in the statistics, the number of shark attack are increasing permanently since 1920, with an acceleration in the 70' when surfing was becoming more and more popular.

But what about the taste of the shark ?  do they prefer to bite men or women ? 
Tough the last decade, the number of women surfing is increasing but is still inferior to proportion of men. â€œWomen accounted for an estimated 3 to 5 percent of the surfing population in 1990; a decade later the figure was thought to be between 10 and 15 percent." In 2015, 25% of surfers are women. 

If we extrapolate this estimation on our shark attack this is how many women should be attack by sharks :

2016    204                                25                  51                  
2010    321                                25                  80
2000    180                                12,5                22

however in reality :

Conclusions: 
- No, sharks prefer man to women or which is the most plausible explaination men take more risks

Cleaning of shark data : 

#Selection of 4 columns : 
df=pd.DataFrame(shark[['Year','Type','Activity','Sex ']])

#Rename of column Sex which has a space at the end
df=df.rename(columns={'Sex ':'Sex'})

#identifiaction of na value
df.isna().sum()

# drop of row with na values -> a missing value conduct a wrong information for the activity. We only want Surfing
df['Activity'].dropna()

# Fill N/A with Undetermined because we want the impact of the women / men or what ever his sex
df['Sex'].fillna('Undetermined')

# We filtered on 3 items : 1- Surfing 2-Since 1890 because it the apparition of surf for the public 3- only Unprovoked
filtered=(df.Activity.str.contains('Surfing'))&(df.Year>1890)&(df.Type.str.contains('Unprovoked'))&(df.Type.str.contains('Genre'))
df=df.loc[filtered]
